# hello-world

I'm learning to code so that I can utilize biomechanics software on the backend.
I want to write a program that can pull information from a force plate because the software my boss purchased sucks.
I'm learning python, which helped me edit already written code in Matlab in the past.
I will eventually learn R if they hire me for data analysis.
I have to prove my worth first.
